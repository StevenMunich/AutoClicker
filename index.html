<p>The 2 main functions on a computer are mouse and keyboard. This program allows you to program those 2 functions "as if a person was there".
Need to act like you are working? Use the auto clicker.
Need to test software over and over to find any bugs? Use the auto clicker.
    Need to annoy someone using google voice to call a number over and over? Use the auto clicker. <br>

The best thing about the auto clicker is you can use it for personal reasons instead of doing repetitive motions on the computer. </p>

<h4>Wait - </h4>
<p>To add a pause between mouse clicks and key strokes add a wait command. <br>
Type the number of seconds and click "Add wait CMD" <br>
    Note: uses a "sleep" function so it may look like the program is not responding</p>


<p>To run the script you have created press "Run" and every command added to the command list will be executed <br>
Click the "Loop" checkbox to make the script executed until you close the program. <br>
    If you are planning to re-use a script you have created save it before running it with a Loop. </p>

        5.  Auto Clicker/Typer to automate repetitive tasks.
 
What are the 2 things people do on a computer? They click a mouse and type on the keyboard. This program allows users to simulate both, with an extra wait command between the two actions. The X & Y coordinates change as you move your mouse. So the user can move the mouse to the position they want and press ‘insert’ to copy the coordinates into the program
The 5 commands:
	M – moves the mouse
	 R – Right Click
	 L  – Left Click
	T – Type from keyboard
              W – Wait(seconds)
 
Interprets to:
Move Mouse to 15,888
Right click at 15,888, the windows start icon
Waits 2 seconds
Left click at 131, 585, opens PowerShell
Waits 20 seconds
Types in command “netstat -o”
Waits 1 second
Types the enter key
The Loop checkbox under the “RUN” button allows the script to be repeated..
Future Improvements:
	– make it so simple even my grandma can use it.
	– eventually added to the next version of windows OS
I’ve used this program to scrape my college e-books. Publishers only give students limited time access and do not allow direct download.

	<p>Features to add: drap& drop (hold)+(move) 1-Left click hold without release 2-Right click hold without release combined with move = drag&drop
